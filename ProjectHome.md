This Plug-in is able to deploy a fast interface with the concepts, news and chat of The Venus Project and its community.

We are currently designing the features list so we can Open-Source the project through de many TVP groups and chapters around the world.

This project comes out of the need to integrate the tools related to "The Venus Project" in a simple and effective way. As you know, there is a main site, an activist site, a community site, Facebook page, Youtube channel, multimedia area, etc...

To simplify the access to all this information, this Plug-in will group all the related sites into categories for easy access and invite the user to discover all the subjects related to "The Venus Project".
